* Directory structure changed (many things in different directories now)

* Sedna namespace finally changed to "sedna.org" (TODO : fix all that mentions it)

* As soon as now SEDNA_DATA is actually the first thing, process know about,
  there is no need to use stupid set_data_dir as fault directory

* Global memory mapping have now an instance per database

* Global objects are now string constants, and should be referenced via
  GLOBALNAME macro which stringize them
