Persistent Heap implementation
Copyright (c) 2003, 2004 ISP RAS. All rights reserved.


This is persistent heap implementation based on Mike Haertel's malloc 
implementation written by him in 1993. What is persistent heap? It's a memory 
heap (like almost everyone understands it) that allows you to save everything 
inside it between program runs.

Because I developed this library in the period of absence of time, the 
implementation is "quick and dirty". One disadvantage is that 
persistent heap works only under Windows and Linux. I've tested it on Windows 
2000 and Red Hat Linux 9.0. Another disadvantage is that the library was 
sharpened for my special purpose, but it can be easily modified for others 
needs.

Use MS VC++ 7.0 or GCC to build the library.
